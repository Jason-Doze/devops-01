Operating Systems:
Kernel: The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.

 Scheduler: In computing, scheduling is the action of assigning resources to perform tasks. The resources may be processors, network links or expansion cards. The tasks may be threads, processes or data flows. The scheduling activity is carried out by a process called scheduler.

Input/Output: Input/output management - it handles input to and output from attached hardware devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard disks, and printers. Ensuring that device drivers are present and up to date is another responsibility of the input/output management layer.

User Space: A modern computer operating system usually segregates virtual memory into user space and kernel space. Primarily, this separation serves to provide memory protection and hardware protection from malicious or errant software behaviour.

Programming Languages: 

Assembly: 
Assembly language is the closest computer language to communicate with computers. It is the machine language (1s and 0s) that a CPU uses to operate in an easy to remember and understand format. Only assembly language can take the full advantages of the processor architecture, and it is hardware dependent.


C Programming Language: C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.

HTML: The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Compiled Language:
A compiled language is a programming language which are generally compiled and not interpreted. It is one where the program, once compiled, is expressed in the instructions of the target machine; this machine code is undecipherable by humans. Types of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.

Interpreted Language:
An interpreted language is a programming language which are generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program. Interpreted language ranges – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.[1] The technique was originally used to avoid the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced, but could not route the network's address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.[2]

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers reachable through the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. These are most commonly used to map human-friendly domain names to the numerical IP addresses computers need to locate services and devices using the underlying network protocols, but have been extended over time to perform many other functions as well. The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.


# Difference Between IP Address and Hostname

An IP address is a logical numeric address that is assigned to every single computer, printer, switch, router or any other device that is part of a TCP/IP based network. A hostname is a label assigned to a network that transfers the user to a specific website. This is the main difference between IP address and hostname. Another difference between IP address and hostname is that IP address helps to identify a device in the network whereas hostname helps to find out the network that directs the user to a certain website or a webpage.

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. In contrast, a hostname is a label assigned to a network that sends the user to a specific website or a webpage. This is the main difference between IP address and Hostname.



# What is a computer network port?
A port in computer networking is how a computer can use a single physical network connection to handle many incoming and outgoing requests by assigning a port number to each. The numbers go from 0 to 65535, which is a 16-bit number.

Some of these port numbers are specifically defined and always associated with a specific type of service -- These are called well-known ports and go from 0 to 1023. The numbers from 1024 to 49151 are called registered ports and can be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for a specific use. The numbers 49152 to 65535 are unassigned, can be used by any type of service and are called dynamic ports, private ports or ephemeral ports. As an illustration, think of a port number as a telephone extension in a business telephone system. The company telephone number is like the computer Internet Protocol (IP) address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL). It connects users with the correct company but does not define who they want to talk to in the company. A telephone extension will connect them with the right person in an organization, however, and the port will connect them to the right service on a computer. Dialing extension 0 to speak to an operator is extremely common in all phone systems and is like the well-known ports that always define specific services. The port is specified by having the URL or IP address followed by a colon then the port number -- as examples, 10.0.0.1:80 or www.techtarget.com:443. With all internet communication, there is always an associated port, but it may not be shown to the user as it is often implied by the type of communication.

  File Transfer Protocol (FTP) -is always port number 21 
  Hypertext Transfer Protocol -web traffic is always port 80. 
  SSH -the default port for SSH client connections is 22; to change this default, enter a port number between 1024 and 32,767.
  HTTPS -connections by default, use TCP port 443. 
  HTTP -the unsecure protocol, uses port 80.
  mySQL -Port 3306 is the default port for the classic MySQL protocol which is used by the mysql client, MySQL Connectors, and utilities such as mysqldump and mysqlpump.

Port vs IP 
Port numbers identify a particular application or service on a system. An IP address identifies a machine in an IP network and determines the destination of a data packet, while port numbers identify particular applications or services on a system.
